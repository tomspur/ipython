IPython: an enhanced interactive Python shell.

    A Python shell with automatic history (input and output), dynamic object
    introspection, easier configuration, command completion, access to the
    system shell and more.  IPython can also be embedded in running programs.

    If invoked with no options, it executes all the files listed in sequence
    and exits, use -i to enter interactive mode after running the files.  Files
    ending in .py will be treated as normal Python, but files ending in .ipy
    can contain special IPython syntax (magic commands, shell expansions, etc.)

    Please note that some of the configuration options are not available at the
    command line, simply because they are not practical here. Look into your
    ipython_config.py configuration file for details on those.

    This file typically installed in the $HOME/.ipython directory.  For Windows
    users, $HOME resolves to C:\\Documents and Settings\\YourUserName in most
    instances.

    In IPython's documentation, we will refer to this directory as IPYTHON_DIR,
    you can change its default location by setting any path you want in this
    environment variable.

    For more information, see the manual available in HTML and PDF in your
    installation, or online at http://ipython.scipy.org.

IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python
=========================================

IPython offers a combination of convenient shell features, special commands
and a history mechanism for both input (command history) and output (results
caching, similar to Mathematica). It is intended to be a fully compatible
replacement for the standard Python interpreter, while offering vastly
improved functionality and flexibility.

At your system command line, type 'ipython -help' to see the command line
options available. This document only describes interactive features.

Warning: IPython relies on the existence of a global variable called __IP which
controls the shell itself. If you redefine __IP to anything, bizarre behavior
will quickly occur.

MAIN FEATURES

* Access to the standard Python help. As of Python 2.1, a help system is
  available with access to object docstrings and the Python manuals. Simply
  type 'help' (no quotes) to access it.

* Magic commands: type %magic for information on the magic subsystem.

* System command aliases, via the %alias command or the ipythonrc config file.

* Dynamic object information:

  Typing ?word or word? prints detailed information about an object.  If
  certain strings in the object are too long (docstrings, code, etc.) they get
  snipped in the center for brevity.

  Typing ??word or word?? gives access to the full information without
  snipping long strings. Long strings are sent to the screen through the less
  pager if longer than the screen, printed otherwise.

  The ?/?? system gives access to the full source code for any object (if
  available), shows function prototypes and other useful information.

  If you just want to see an object's docstring, type '%pdoc object' (without
  quotes, and without % if you have automagic on).

  Both %pdoc and ?/?? give you access to documentation even on things which are
  not explicitely defined. Try for example typing {}.get? or after import os,
  type os.path.abspath??. The magic functions %pdef, %source and %file operate
  similarly.

* Completion in the local namespace, by typing TAB at the prompt.

  At any time, hitting tab will complete any available python commands or
  variable names, and show you a list of the possible completions if there's
  no unambiguous one. It will also complete filenames in the current directory.

  This feature requires the readline and rlcomplete modules, so it won't work
  if your Python lacks readline support (such as under Windows).

* Search previous command history in two ways (also requires readline):

  - Start typing, and then use Ctrl-p (previous,up) and Ctrl-n (next,down) to
  search through only the history items that match what you've typed so
  far. If you use Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n at a blank prompt, they just behave like
  normal arrow keys.

  - Hit Ctrl-r: opens a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches
  your history for lines that match what you've typed so far, completing as
  much as it can.

* Persistent command history across sessions (readline required).

* Logging of input with the ability to save and restore a working session.
  
* System escape with !. Typing !ls will run 'ls' in the current directory.

* The reload command does a 'deep' reload of a module: changes made to the
  module since you imported will actually be available without having to exit.

* Verbose and colored exception traceback printouts. See the magic xmode and
  xcolor functions for details (just type %magic).

* Input caching system:

  IPython offers numbered prompts (In/Out) with input and output caching. All
  input is saved and can be retrieved as variables (besides the usual arrow
  key recall).

  The following GLOBAL variables always exist (so don't overwrite them!):
  _i: stores previous input.
  _ii: next previous.
  _iii: next-next previous.
  _ih : a list of all input _ih[n] is the input from line n.

  Additionally, global variables named _i<n> are dynamically created (<n>
  being the prompt counter), such that _i<n> == _ih[<n>]

  For example, what you typed at prompt 14 is available as _i14 and _ih[14].

  You can create macros which contain multiple input lines from this history,
  for later re-execution, with the %macro function.

  The history function %hist allows you to see any part of your input history
  by printing a range of the _i variables. Note that inputs which contain
  magic functions (%) appear in the history with a prepended comment. This is
  because they aren't really valid Python code, so you can't exec them.

* Output caching system:

  For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input
  cache exists but using _ instead of _i. Only actions that produce a result
  (NOT assignments, for example) are cached. If you are familiar with
  Mathematica, IPython's _ variables behave exactly like Mathematica's %
  variables.

  The following GLOBAL variables always exist (so don't overwrite them!):
  _ (one underscore): previous output.
  __ (two underscores): next previous.
  ___ (three underscores): next-next previous.

  Global variables named _<n> are dynamically created (<n> being the prompt
  counter), such that the result of output <n> is always available as _<n>.

  Finally, a global dictionary named _oh exists with entries for all lines
  which generated output.

* Directory history:

  Your history of visited directories is kept in the global list _dh, and the
  magic %cd command can be used to go to any entry in that list.

* Auto-parentheses and auto-quotes (adapted from Nathan Gray's LazyPython)

    1. Auto-parentheses
        Callable objects (i.e. functions, methods, etc) can be invoked like
        this (notice the commas between the arguments):
            >>> callable_ob arg1, arg2, arg3
        and the input will be translated to this:
            --> callable_ob(arg1, arg2, arg3)
        You can force auto-parentheses by using '/' as the first character
        of a line.  For example:
            >>> /globals             # becomes 'globals()'
        Note that the '/' MUST be the first character on the line!  This
        won't work:
            >>> print /globals    # syntax error
            
        In most cases the automatic algorithm should work, so you should
        rarely need to explicitly invoke /. One notable exception is if you
        are trying to call a function with a list of tuples as arguments (the
        parenthesis will confuse IPython):
            In [1]: zip (1,2,3),(4,5,6)  # won't work
        but this will work:
            In [2]: /zip (1,2,3),(4,5,6)
            ------> zip ((1,2,3),(4,5,6))
            Out[2]= [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]        

        IPython tells you that it has altered your command line by
        displaying the new command line preceded by -->.  e.g.:
            In [18]: callable list
            -------> callable (list) 

    2. Auto-Quoting
        You can force auto-quoting of a function's arguments by using ',' as
        the first character of a line.  For example:
            >>> ,my_function /home/me   # becomes my_function("/home/me")

        If you use ';' instead, the whole argument is quoted as a single
        string (while ',' splits on whitespace):
            >>> ,my_function a b c   # becomes my_function("a","b","c")
            >>> ;my_function a b c   # becomes my_function("a b c")

        Note that the ',' MUST be the first character on the line!  This
        won't work:
            >>> x = ,my_function /home/me    # syntax error

IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python - Quick Reference Card
================================================================

obj?, obj??      : Get help, or more help for object (also works as
                   ?obj, ??obj).
?foo.*abc*       : List names in 'foo' containing 'abc' in them.
%magic           : Information about IPython's 'magic' % functions.

Magic functions are prefixed by %, and typically take their arguments without
parentheses, quotes or even commas for convenience.
 
Example magic function calls:

%alias d ls -F   : 'd' is now an alias for 'ls -F'
alias d ls -F    : Works if 'alias' not a python name
alist = %alias   : Get list of aliases to 'alist'
cd /usr/share    : Obvious. cd -<tab> to choose from visited dirs.
%cd??            : See help AND source for magic %cd

System commands:
    
!cp a.txt b/     : System command escape, calls os.system()
cp a.txt b/      : after %rehashx, most system commands work without !
cp ${f}.txt $bar : Variable expansion in magics and system commands
files = !ls /usr : Capture sytem command output
files.s, files.l, files.n: "a b c", ['a','b','c'], 'a\nb\nc'

History:

_i, _ii, _iii    : Previous, next previous, next next previous input
_i4, _ih[2:5]    : Input history line 4, lines 2-4
exec _i81        : Execute input history line #81 again
%rep 81          : Edit input history line #81        
_, __, ___       : previous, next previous, next next previous output
_dh              : Directory history
_oh              : Output history
%hist            : Command history. '%hist -g foo' search history for 'foo'

Autocall:

f 1,2            : f(1,2)
/f 1,2           : f(1,2) (forced autoparen)
,f 1 2           : f("1","2")
;f 1 2           : f("1 2")

Remember: TAB completion works in many contexts, not just file names
or python names.

The following magic functions are currently available:
