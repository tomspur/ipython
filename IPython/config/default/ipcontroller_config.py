# Basic Global config attributes

# Start up messages are logged to stdout using the logging module.
# These all happen before the twisted reactor is started and are
# useful for debugging purposes. Can be (10=DEBUG,20=INFO,30=WARN,40=CRITICAL) 
# and smaller is more verbose.
# c.Global.log_level = 20

# Log to a file in cluster_dir/log, otherwise just log to sys.stdout.
# c.Global.log_to_file = False

# Remove old logs from cluster_dir/log before starting.
# c.Global.clean_logs = True

# A list of Python statements that will be run before starting the 
# controller. This is provided because occasionally certain things need to 
# be imported in the controller for pickling to work.
# c.Global.import_statements = ['import math']

# Reuse the controller's FURL files. If False, FURL files are regenerated
# each time the controller is run. If True, they will be reused, *but*, you
# also must set the network ports by hand. If set, this will override the
# values set for the client and engine connections below.
# c.Global.reuse_furls = True

# Enable SSL encryption on all connections to the controller. If set, this
# will override the values set for the client and engine connections below.

# The working directory for the process. The application will use os.chdir
# to change to this directory before starting.

# Configure the client services
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Basic client service config attributes

# This should be an IP address or hostname of the controller's host. The empty
# string means listen on all interfaces.

# a random port will be used. If the controller's host has a firewall running
# it must allow incoming traffic on this port.
# c.FCClientServiceFactory.port = 0

# The client learns how to connect to the controller by looking at the
# location field embedded in the FURL. If this field is empty, all network
# interfaces that the controller is listening on will be listed. To have the
# client connect on a particular interface, list it here.
# c.FCClientServiceFactory.location = ''

# Configure the engine services
